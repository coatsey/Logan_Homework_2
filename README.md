My website has 3 html files (index.html, Contact.html, Portfolio.html) and a css.style sheet.
Each html has it's own funtioning nav bar
The index.html has a picture of me and a short bio. 
Contact.html has a place to put you name, email and message. it also has a small instagram link in the nav bar.
Portfolio.html just has some pictures of me.
